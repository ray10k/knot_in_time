Getting sentenced for a year imprisonment for *jaywalking* of all things already felt pretty unfair. Getting shoved into No-tick-tower definitely felt unfair. Being told that the year is counted by the infamously unmoving clock at the top of the tower right before the guard slammed the door shut... well, that made the entire thing feel more like a cruel joke. Oh well, there's a wrench on the floor and a whole bunch of cobwebbed-over machinery. Time to fix things up and get that clock spinning at top-speed, and maybe cut your forever-sentence a bit shorter!
