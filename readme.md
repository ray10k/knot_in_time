The end-times were upon us. The temporal fabric of reality had begun to fray, and was now falling apart.
It's up to you to make things right.

# Knot in Time
You, as one particularly temporally stable individual, have to operate the Temporal Loom, restore the stability of the timeline and hopefully fix whatever went wrong in the first place, or you'll be the last person to die. Ever.

## Temporal Stability
Turns out there is an only slightly nonsensical reason not to travel through time: If you're not careful, certain actions can damage the flow of time itself! And the further back in time the damage occurred, the more intense the effects in the 'Now.' How do we know this? Well, time has taken a horrible beating and is now actively getting torn to shreds by the accumulated effects. Someone did something, and now time and space are about to fail on a fundamental level...

## The Temporal Loom
A marvel of engineering and science, this complicated, wibbly wobbly piece of time-weaving equipment is humanity's last hope to get out of this mess. It can send stuff back in time, or retrieve materials from earlier in the timeline, hopefully allowing you to restore some temporal stability and not have everything fall apart on you.

### The Loom is not doing well.
Being a last-ditch effort, the Loom's development was cut horrendously short, and it's barely functional. Thankfully, if you can just fix a *little* of the damage to the fabric of time, there will have been more time to develop the Loom, meaning the Loom you're working with is a little more powerful, a little more capable!

## Goal of the game
You start out with 0.1% temporal stability. It is up to you to work your way back along the fabric of time, applying quick fixes and little patches until you can reach back far enough to find what caused this mess in the first place and fix it, once and for all.
